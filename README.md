A online blog utilizing React that is deployed through Amazon Web Services (AWS).


## Usage

Deployment of the app can be found at: 
- http://ec2-18-118-105-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

The AWS instance for this app has been turned off at this time to prevent unnecessary charges, so most functionality of the React app will not work.
